# Pizza-terminal

The Pizza terminal database project explores and applies fundamental concepts of database management systems (DBMS) and SQL.

## Purpose

This project aims to gain practical experience in database design, implementation, and management. Key objectives include understanding entity-relationship modeling, practicing SQL queries, exploring indexing, transactions, and optimizing database performance.

### Important Lessons Learned:

1. **Managing Many-to-Many Relationships**: Handling complex relationships efficiently.
2. **SQL vs. NoSQL**: Recognizing SQL limitations and when NoSQL is relevant.
3. **Query Execution Sequence**: Understanding the sequence of SQL queries.
4. **Joint Selection**: Selecting appropriate JOIN operations for efficient data retrieval.
5. **Data Generation and Importing**: Generating and importing realistic data.

## Key Usage of the Database

This dataset is suitable for learning data visualization techniques. With diverse information on pizza orders, customer details, and payment methods, it offers ample opportunities to explore visualization tools and methods effectively.

## Methodology

1. **Understanding Requirements**: Researching pizza store operations to determine table structure.
2. **Database Design**: Creating a detailed relational schema using Lucidchart.
3. **Artificial Data Generation**: Executing Python scripts to generate and refine data.
4. **Data Import and Refinement**: Importing data into MySQL and handling specific columns for consistency.
5. **Handling Foreign Key Constraint Error**: Resolving foreign key constraint errors during data import.
6. **Final SQL Steps**: Executing SQL files to update subtotal prices, bill details, and payment details.

Following these steps ensures the Pizza_terminal database is populated with artificial but realistic data, ready for querying and other operations.
