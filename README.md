# Pizza-terminal

The Pizza terminal database project explores and applies fundamental concepts of database management systems (DBMS) and SQL.
![Project Schema](./)
## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is twofold: to master SQL practices and to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions for real-world challenges. By creating a comprehensive database for a pizza terminal, the project aims to provide hands-on experience in database design, query optimization, and data management. Participants will delve into crucial topics such as normalization, key constraints, indexing, and transactions in DBMS. In SQL, focus will be on mastering various clauses like JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY, as well as understanding subqueries, views, and query optimization techniques. 

### Important Lessons Learned:

During the development of the Pizza_terminal database project, several key lessons were learned:
1.	Managing Many-to-Many Relationships: Understanding how to manage many-to-many relationships between tables, such as the relationship between pizzas and ingredients.
2.	SQL vs. NoSQL: Recognizing the limitations of SQL and when NoSQL databases become relevant, especially for semi-structured data where flexibility in schema design is required.
3. 	Query Execution Sequence: Learning the sequence of executing SQL queries and the importance of clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY.
4. 	Joint Selection: Gaining insights into selecting the appropriate type of JOIN operation to retrieve data efficiently, balancing between performance and accuracy.
5.	Data Generation and Importing: Understanding the importance of careful data generation and importing into tables, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and performance. while taking care of normalization in relations. 


## Key Usage of the Database

This dataset is suitable for learning data visualization techniques. With diverse information on pizza orders, customer details, and payment methods, it offers ample opportunities to explore visualization tools and methods effectively.

## Methodology

1. **Understanding Requirements**: Researching pizza store operations to determine table structure.
2. **Database Design**: Creating a detailed relational schema using Lucidchart.
3. **Artificial Data Generation**: Executing Python scripts to generate and refine data.
4. **Data Import and Refinement**: Importing data into MySQL and handling specific columns for consistency.
5. **Handling Foreign Key Constraint Error**: Resolving foreign key constraint errors during data import.
6. **Final SQL Steps**: Executing SQL files to update subtotal prices, bill details, and payment details.

Following these steps ensures the Pizza_terminal database is populated with artificial but realistic data, ready for querying and other operations.

### Querying and Optimization

After implementation, focus shifts to querying and optimization, involving writing SQL queries, creating indexes, and analyzing query execution plans for enhanced performance.
